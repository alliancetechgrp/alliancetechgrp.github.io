<h1>Alliance Technical Group</h1>
Yep, we are here. 
<br>
When we aren't elbow deep in code, we'll get this webpage setup, with really cool marketing phrases like 
<br>
<ul>
<li>Open Source full stack development</li>
<li>Enterprise data application and ETL expertise</li>
<li>Data visualization</li>
<li>Machine learning</li>
<li>Value-driven development</li>
</ul>
<br>
Until then, we probably have work comning out our ears, so don't email <a href="mailto:info@alliancetechgrp.com">info@alliancetechgrp.com</a>, because then we'll have to respond immediately and we may never get this webpage done ;-)
